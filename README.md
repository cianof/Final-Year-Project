## Code Description
There are a total of 7 notebooks contained in the repository, there is a notebook for each model trained and also notebooks for the advanced evaluation section e.g. the Addition of Noise. There is a RPiScripts directory which contains all the relevant scripts and tflite models for making live inferences on the raspberry pi. There is also a sub directory called Trained_Models which contains a total of 6 fully trained models.

## Instructions

To run the project, download the requirements.txt file and run the command "pip install -r requirements.txt" in the folder where the file is located. After requirements are installed the Jupyter Notebooks need to be downloaded and run. It must be noted that the majority of notebooks were written in the google colab environment and therefore there may be some dependancy/file path updates required to run notebooks locally.

The RPIScripts directory can be considered seperate and contains scripts and models for use on the raspberry pi.
